# AI-Powered Flight Path Optimizer

This project uses AI techniques to optimize flight paths for efficiency, cost, and time. It processes flight and airport data to find the best routes.

## Features
- Load and preprocess flight and airport data.
- Optimize flight paths using AI algorithms.
- Visualize optimized flight paths.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Powered-Flight-Path-Optimizer.git
   cd AI-Powered-Flight-Path-Optimizer
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:

bash
Copy
bash run.sh
Usage
Place your flight and airport data in the data/ directory.

Run the main.py script to optimize flight paths.

Data Format
airports.csv: Contains airport details (e.g., IATA code, latitude, longitude).

flights.csv: Contains flight details (e.g., origin, destination, distance, duration).
